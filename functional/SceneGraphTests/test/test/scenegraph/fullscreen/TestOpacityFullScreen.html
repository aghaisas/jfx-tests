        <p>This test verifies changing opacity in Mac OS X native full screen mode works properly.
        <p>Test workflow:
        <ul>
            <li> Only for Mac OS X 10.7 or higher! Please mark the test as PASS on other platforms.
            <li> Enter to native full screen mode.
            <li> Try change opacity of the window by slider.
            <li> Opacity must not change. 
            <li> There should be no errors.
            <li> Exit native full screen mode.
            <li> Opacity should change in proportion to slider position (the further left the slider position is, the more transparent the window should be).
        </ul>

        <p><b>Interpolator Test</b>
        <p>This test verify that different implementations of javafx.animation.Interpolator works correctly. It visualize every Interpolator in Timeline
            as a function from time (in terms of this Timeline).
        <p>Test workflow:
        <ul>
            <li>You should see window frame titled "Interpolator".
            <li>Don't move window or perform any actions on computer until drawing ends.
            <li>Verify there are 7 animations are being drawn in this frame.
            <li>Wait till all animations in this frame finish.
            <li>Every animation has a title. Verify described behaviour for each title as listed below.
                <br>For every animation verify that it starts from <font style="color:green;font-weight: bold">green</font> circle
                under the title and ends at the bottom <font style="color:red;font-weight: bold">red</font> line.
                <ul>
                    <li>LINEAR: straight line</li>
                    <li>EASE_IN: almost straight line with a curve at the start</li>
                    <li>EASE_OUT: almost straight line with a curves near the end</li>
                    <li>EASE_BOTH: almost straight line with curves at the start and near the end</li>
                    <li>DISCRETE: horizontal line connected to vertical line</li>
                    <li>SPLINE: parabolic line</li>
                    <li>CUSTOM: sinusoidal line</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Note image may not look exactly as one below, judge according to table above.

        </ul>

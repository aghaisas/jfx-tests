        <h2>Image loading manual test</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Install runtime</h3>
        <ul><li>If you had runtime installed from <b>other</b> FX SDK remove it.</li>
            <li>Download JDK cobundle. </li> 
			<li>FX runtime should be installed with JDK cobundle.</li> 
        </ul>
        N.B.: note that you can install new runtime just once for each sdk version testing.
        <h3>Step 2: Run app</h3>
		Take a look at the application which presents same image on black and white backgrounds.
		<br>
		Please open the following file <b>animated.html</b> and use following image for comparison: <b>infinite_loop.gif</b> with <b>number 11</b>
        <br>
		Look at the images and verify following items:
		<li>image loaded</li> 
		<li>images in browser and application looks similar except that the background area width in browser could differs from background area width in application(in app background area width is the same as image width, and in browser NOT).  Take an account that image can have transparent areas.</li> 
		<li>if images are animated verify that animations looks equals. Please note that it's possible that animation playback can be asynchronius (shifted) because of different loading time.</li> 
		<li>note that background in app has the same width as image, and image background in browser  has the same width as table cell. So it may be different and it's OK.</li> 
        <br>
        In case of successful verification press pass, otherwise fail.

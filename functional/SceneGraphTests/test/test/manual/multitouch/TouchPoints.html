        <h2>Touch Points Test</h2>
        
        <h3>Prerequisites: Installed FX runtime, multitouch hardware support</h3>
        <ul><li>Uninstalled all previous version of FX sdk & runtime;</li>
            <li>Installed FX runtime </li>            
            <li>Please see SceneGraphTests/README-mutitouch.html file to get 
                basic knowledges about multitouch. </li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Test workflow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> This test is applicable only for touch screen. In other case press "Passed"</li>
            <li> Take a look at the test application. It looks like (without colored circles after start):
                <br>
                <img src="./TouchPointsTest_imgs/TouchPoints.png">
                <ul>
                    <li><font color="red">Red</font> circle marks pressed TouchPoint (stay at touched point and fade);</li>
                    <li><font color="green">Green</font> circle marks moved TouchPoint (follow a touch point);</li>
                    <li><font color="blue">Blue</font> circle marks stationary TouchPoint;</li>
                    <li><font color="darkgrey">Grey</font> circle marks released TouchPoint (stay at released point and fade);</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> When you use two-fingers for touch the line must be drawn between touch points. 
                Also the center between touch points is marked 
                <br>
                <img src="./TouchPointsTest_imgs/TwoFingers.png">
            </li>
            <li> Use touch screen and check the position & color of the circles. 
                Sometimes hardware touch screen can send strange events. 
                This usually associated  with the dirty screen or features touch 
                screen with your finger </li>
            <li> So check that general touch screen events are correct. 
                And you can see circles with rights colors at right places 
                (where you touch, move, hold & release finger) </li>
            <li> Push toggle button "TouchPress/Release" </li>
            <li> Touch screen on the scene and move finger to left outside the scene. 
                Then release finger from touch screen </li>
            <li> See at the message log. Check the <b>X coordinate</b> of the point in 
                TOUCH_RELEASED event. In case <b>X coordinate</b> >= 0 test fail.
                <pre>
TouchEvent [..., eventType = TOUCH_RELEASED, ... , touchPoint = TouchPoint [state = RELEASED, id = 1, target = VBox@4ba046fe, x = -163.0, y = 318.0]
                </pre>
            
            </li>
            <li> Push button "ClearLog" </li>
            <li> Touch screen on the scene and move finger to up outside the scene. 
                Then release finger from touch screen </li>
            <li> See at the message log. Check the <b>Y coordinate</b> of the point in 
                TOUCH_RELEASED event. In case <b>Y coordinate</b> >= 0 test fail.
                <pre>
TouchEvent [..., eventType = TOUCH_RELEASED, ... , touchPoint = TouchPoint [state = RELEASED, id = 1, target = VBox@4ba046fe, x = 136.0, y = -198.0]
                </pre>
            </li>

            <li> In case of successful verifications test pass, otherwise fail </li>
        </ol>

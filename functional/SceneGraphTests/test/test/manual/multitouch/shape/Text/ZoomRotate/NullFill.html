        <h2>Multitouch Shape Test: Text, Zoom / Rotate gesture,  null fill</h2>

        <h3>Prerequisites: Installed FX runtime, multitouch hardware support</h3>
        <ul><li>Uninstalled all previous version of FX sdk & runtime;</li>
            <li>Installed FX runtime </li>            
            <li>Please see <b>SceneGraphTests/README-mutitouch.html</b> file to get 
                basic knowledges about multitouch. </li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Test workflow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Take a look at the test application (MultiTouchApp)</li>
            <li> If test runs on the computer with touch screen push toggle button "Direct" 
                (for touch pad using this button must be unselected) </li>
            <li> Push button "AddText" </li>
            <li> Check that the text "Java FX" is painted at the center of the scene </li>
            <li> Double click on the shape </li>
            <li> Check that shape fill is changed to null (shape becomes not ) </li>
            <li> Push toggle buttons "Log ZoomStart/Finish" & "Log RotateStart/Finish" </li>
            <li> Do <b>Zoom / Rotate </b> gesture the shape. Be sure that center 
                between touches is inside the text rectangle and that center is not over 
                the text symbols
            </li>
            <li> In case shape stays half-transparent after gesture start - test fail</li>
            <li> In case shape is not scaled during gesture - test fail </li>
            <li> In case shape is not rotated during gesture - test fail </li>
            <li> In case shape is not half-transparent after gesture end (no touches) - test fail  </li>

            <li> In case of successful verification press pass, otherwise fail </li>

        </ol>

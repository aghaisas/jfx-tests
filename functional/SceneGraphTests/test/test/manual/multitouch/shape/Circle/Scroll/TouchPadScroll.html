        <h2>Multitouch Shape Test: Circle; Scroll gesture (Touch Pad)</h2>

        <h3>Prerequisites: Installed FX runtime, multitouch hardware support</h3>
        <ul><li>Uninstalled all previous version of FX sdk & runtime;</li>
            <li>Installed FX runtime </li>            
            <li>Please see SceneGraphTests/README-mutitouch.html file to get 
                basic knowledges about multitouch. </li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Test workflow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Take a look at the test application (MultiTouchApp)</li>
            <li> This test is applicable only for Mac OS X with touch pad. 
                In other case press "Passed"</li>
            <li> <b>Use Node.addEventHandler to receive multitouch events: </b>
            <ol> 
                <li> Select <b>"ADD_HANDLER"</b> (it is default value) in the choice box </li>
                <li> Push button "AddCircle" </li>
                <li> Check that a random circle is painted on the scene </li>
                <li> Move mouse pointer to the shape and do <b>Scroll</b> gesture with the touch pad.</li>
                <li> In case shape stays half-transparent after gesture start - test fail </li>
                <li> In case the shape doesn't drag during gesture - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not half-transparent after gesture end (no touches) - test fail  </li>
                <li> Push button "ClearScene" </li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li> <b>Use Node.addEventFilter to receive multitouch events: </b>

                <li> Select <b>"ADD_FILTER"</b> in the choice box </li>
                <li> Push button "AddCircle" </li>
                <li> Check that a random circle is painted on the scene </li>
                <li> Move mouse pointer to the shape and do <b>Scroll</b> gesture with the touch pad.</li>
                <li> In case shape stays half-transparent after gesture start - test fail </li>
                <li> In case the shape doesn't drag during gesture - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not half-transparent after gesture end (no touches) - test fail  </li>
                <li> Push button "ClearScene" </li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li> <b>Use Node.setOn&lt;EventType&gt; handler to receive multitouch events: </b>
            <ol> 
                <li> Select <b>"SET_ON_EVENT_HANDLER"</b> in the choice box </li>
                <li> Push button "AddCircle" </li>
                <li> Check that a random circle is painted on the scene </li>
                <li> Move mouse pointer to the shape and do <b>Scroll</b> gesture with the touch pad.</li>
                <li> In case shape stays half-transparent after gesture start - test fail </li>

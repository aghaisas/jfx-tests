        <h2>Multitouch Shape Test: Ellipse, Zoom / Rotate gesture, not null fill</h2>

        <h3>Prerequisites: Installed FX runtime, multitouch hardware support</h3>
        <ul><li>Uninstalled all previous version of FX sdk & runtime;</li>
            <li>Installed FX runtime </li>            
            <li>Please see SceneGraphTests/README-mutitouch.html file to get 
                basic knowledges about multitouch. </li>            
        </ul>

        <h3>Test workflow:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Take a look at the test application (MultiTouchApp)</li>
            <li> If test runs on the computer with touch screen push toggle button "Direct" 
                (for touch pad using this button must be unselected) </li>
            <li> <b>Use Node.addEventHandler to receive multitouch events: </b>
            <ol> 
                <li> Select <b>"ADD_HANDLER"</b> (it is default value) in the choice box </li>
                <li> Push button "AddEllipse" </li>
                <li> Check that a random half-transparent ellipse is painted on the scene </li>
                <li> Do <b>Zoom / Rotate </b> gesture for the shape.
                    Be sure that center between touches is inside the shape
                </li>
                <li> In case shape stays half-transparent after gesture start - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not scaled during gesturing - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not rotated during gesturing - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not half-transparent after gesture end (no touches) - test fail  </li>
                <li> Push button "ClearScene" </li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li> <b>Use Node.addEventFilter to receive multitouch events: </b>
            <ol> 
                <li> Select <b>"ADD_FILTER"</b> in the choice box </li>
                <li> Push button "AddEllipse" </li>
                <li> Check that a random ellipse is painted on the scene </li>
                <li> Do zoom gesture for the shape</li>
                <li> In case shape stays half-transparent after gesture start - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not scaled during gesture - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not rotated during gesturing - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not half-transparent after gesture end (no touches) - test fail  </li>
                <li> Push button "ClearScene" </li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li> <b>Use Node.setOn&lt;EventType&gt; handler to receive multitouch events: </b>
            <ol> 
                <li> Select <b>"SET_ON_EVENT_HANDLER"</b> in the choice box </li>
                <li> Push button "AddEllipse" </li>
                <li> Check that a random ellipse is painted on the scene </li>
                <li> Do zoom gesture for the shape</li>
                <li> In case shape stays half-transparent after gesture start - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not scaled during gesture - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not rotated during gesture - test fail </li>
                <li> In case shape is not half-transparent after gesture end (no touches) - test fail  </li>
            </ol>
            </li>

            <li> In case of successful verification press pass, otherwise fail </li>

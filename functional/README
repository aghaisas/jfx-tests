This directory contain functional test suites for JavaFX.

As a general rule, one must be able to build a suite by calling 
$ ant -Djavafx.rt=â€¦

Please consult root repository readme on how to set javafx.rt variable.

Next, to run the test, one have option of opening a suite project in NetBeans and run the tests from the IDE, or by issuing a command:
$ ant test

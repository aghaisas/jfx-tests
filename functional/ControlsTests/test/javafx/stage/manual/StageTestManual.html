        <h2>Stage parameters test</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        Stage - is a window, which is provided by operation system for an 
        application. It can be in different states : maximised, iconified, 
        fullscreen, and other, and also has paramteres : x, y, width, height.
        Some parameters you can change, and some of them you can only observe 
        for changes. We will test changing the changable parameters and check, 
        that we are notified about changable parameters.

        <h3>Note</h3>

        You can see text fields, which contain actual value of the property, 
        which is mentioned on the left side from the text field. You can see 
        previous values, in tooltip, related to each textfield.
        
        During different manupilations with window, check please, that scene 
        doesn't blink, doesn't become black, doesn't disappear.

        <h3>Step 1: Fullscreen.</h3>
        <ul><li>Track "fullscreen" property value, while doing the next manipulation</li>
            <li>Click on toggle button "Fullscreen state : false",</li>
            <li>Verify, that scene is in fullscreen mode, and property is set to true.</li>
            <li>Unselect the toggle button, and verify the property value is set to false.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 2: Position.</h3>
        <ul><li>Track "x" and "y" property values, while doing the next manipulation</li>
            <li>Change scene location, and check that x and y are changing correspondingly.</li>
            <li>If you have several screens, move from one screen to another.</li>
            <li>Note : x and y could be negative, depending on which of few monitors is the leading one.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 3: Resizing.</h3>
        <ul><li>Track "width" and "height" properties, while doing the next manipulation</li>
            <li>Resize scene , and check that width and height are changing correspondingly.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 4: Iconification.</h3>
        
        Iconified - it is when application is collapsed on a task bar 
        (in windows or linux), or to the dock in mac os. ]
        
        <ul><li>Check, that "iconified" property, is false.</li>
            <li>Collapse scene ("_" button in the top right corner of stage in 
                windows, "-" round button on mac), and expand it back.</li>
            <li>Check, that value is set to false, still.</li>
            <li>Look at the history of values, and check, that it was set to true.
                (to look at history - move mouse on a text field, to see a tooltip;
                you cannot see directly, when it is true, because it is true, when scene is iconified).</li>
            <li>Only for Mac: (mac supports applications collapse on CMD+H keys combinations). 
                Press CMD+H, check that application would hide. Look at history of values and check
	      that no additional 'true/false' pair appreared.
</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 5: Maximization.</h3>
        
            Maximized - it is when application stage is as huge as possible 
            (use "+" on mac, or rectangular button on windows in the top right corner of the stage)
            
        <ul><li>Check taht "maximized" property is false.</li>
            <li>Maximize stage, and check, that value of property is changed to true.</li>
            <li>Shrink stage, and check, that value is set to false back.</li>
        </ul>
            
        <h3>Step 6: Focused.</h3>
        <ul><li>During this step check, that "focused" property is true, when stage is in focus.</li>
            <li>Focus a stage of some other application, and check, that value is set to false.</li>
            <li>Focus stage with testing scene again, and check, that value is set to true.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>How to change properties' values.</h3>
        
        You can see buttons "unbinded". They allow to bind/unbind
        values of slider (valueProperty - double values), textField (textProperty - string values), toggleButton 
        (selectedProperty - boolean properties), with double, string, boolean properties of tested subject (now - a stage).
        
        BIDI - corresponds to a bidirectional binding, UNIDI - corresponds to a unidirectional binding.
        
        We will use a bidirectional binding (Toggle buttons after BIDI labels).
        
        Select all 3 the most right "unbinded"  toggle buttons, so that they change value to "binded".
        
        <h3>Step 7: Title.</h3>
        <ul><li>Check "title" property's value during this step, and 
                actual title of the stage,</li>
            <li>Change title to "Custom title" (type text into text field, 
                when it is binded).</li>
            <li>Check, that property changed, and stage title is changed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 8: Resizable.</h3>
        <ul><li>Check, that "resizable" property is true by default.</li>
            <li>Change value to false, using according toggle button between 
                "BIDI" and "binded" texts.</li>
            <li>Try to resize stage. You cannot be able to do that.</li>
            <li>Change value back to true.</li>
            <li>Try to resize stage. You must able to do that, and check, that 
                width and height are also changing.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step 9: Opacity.</h3>
        <ul><li>Looking on the text field related to "opacity" property, check, 
                that it is equal to 1.0.</li>
            <li>When property of slider is "binded" move slider, and check, that
                opacity is changing in range [0..1].</li>
            <li>Check, that stage is changing opacity, and value of property is changing.</li>
            <li>Note, that when you move slider to values more than 1.0, or less 
                than 0.0, exception "java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Alpha 
                should be in the range [0f..1f]" is thrown. - it is normal.</li>
        </ul>

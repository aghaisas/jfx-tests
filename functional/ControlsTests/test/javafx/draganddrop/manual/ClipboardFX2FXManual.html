        <h2>Clipboard from FX to FX transfer test</h2>

        <h3>Step 1: Install runtime</h3>
        <ul><li>If you had runtime installed from <b>other</b> FX sdk remove it through Windows Control Panel.</li>
            <li>Otherwise please install runtime: go to <i><b>SDKROOT</b></i> and execute <i>javafx-2.0-beta-windows-i586.exe</i></li>            
        </ul>
        N.B.: note that you can install new runtime just once for each sdk version testing.
        <h3>Step 2: Run apps</h3>
        Run two commands from console from basedir of ControlsTests
        <ul>
            <li><pre>java -jar content/source.jar lightgreen onlySource</pre></li>
            <li><pre>java -jar content/source.jar lightgray onlyTarget</pre></li>
        </ul>
        You should see two windows: with title "Source" and another (target) stage with description of current run mode (rendering, build, etc).
        <h3>Step 3: Verify Data formats</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In each window choose the  "Custom(bytes)", "Custom(string)", "Custom(class)" data formats.
            </li>
            <li>Click "Put to clipboard" and then "paste from clipboard" buttons</li>
            <li>Verify transfered content. You should see in transfered section of Target window:
                <ul>
                    <li>bytes: "1, 2, 3, 4"</li>
                    <li>customString: "Hello Custom String!"</li>
                    <li>customClass: "Class{ clazz=Class{ clazz=null, i=100, d=100.9}, i=10, d=10.9}"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        In case of successfull verification press pass, otherwise fail.

        Don't pay attention on lines between content descriptions on the right side of the scene. They are needed only for convenient view.

        <p>This test verifies image, when DnD is done.</p>
        <p>Test application consists of two windows. The first window has title "Source", the second one has title "Target".</p>
        <p>Source and Target windows contain "source/target data format" checkboxes (Text, HTML, class, image, etc).</p>
        <p>When you do a Drag and Drop, you can specify an image, which will be shown near the cursor. This image looks like this : <img src="img/JavaFX.png"/></p>
        <p>You should choose content type "PLAINTEXT", and do drag and drop : 
            drag button with mouse from green frame from "Source" window to button in red frame in "Target" window.
            Image will be shown, or not, depending on the "Use custom drag view" check box selected state.
            Image must be shown above the cursor (left top corner of image is approximately 100x100 pixels upper and lefter, than cursor).
            If image appears as expected (or doesn't appear, when it is not expected), and aligned correctly (upper that cursor) press pass, overwise fail.</p>

        <p><b>PieChart animation tests</b>
        <p>All charts could be animated, or not (it is switched with a "animated"
            property). The aim of this test is to check animation of chart, and 
            common rendering. When it is animated, actions like adding, 
            removing and changing data values, will be done with animation (it 
            takes time about 700 ms), or without it (immediately).</p>                              
        <h3>Test case 1 : animated</h3>
        <ul><li>If it is not true, switch "animated" property to "true"</li>
            <li>Remove all the data (use corresponding button) - data will be removed from index 0.</li>
            <li>Add some data several times (use corresponding button) - data will be added at index 0.</li>
            <li>Change data items (use corresponding button) - value of data item at index 0 should change (randomly : increase or decrease).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case 2 :  not animated</h3>
        <ul><li>If it is not false, switch "animated" property to "false"</li>
            <li>Remove all the data (use according button).</li>
            <li>Add some data several times (use according button).</li>
            <li>Change data items (use according button).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case 3 :  common rendering</h3>
        <ul><li>Try to rotate chart, changing "start angle property"</li>
            <li>Try to change rotation direction, changing "clockwise" property</li>
            <li>Try to change chart sizes, changing "prefWidth" and "prefHeight" properties</li>
            <li>Try to change header, changing a "title" property</li>
            <li>Try to change sides of title and legend, changing "titleSide" and "legendSide" properties</li>
            <li>Try to hide and show legend, changing "legendVisible" property</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Please, note</h3>
        <h5>Some cases, when part of charts (legend, labels) can disappear - that is normal behavior.</h5>
        <ul> 
            <li>Legend could disappear, when there is no enough space</li>
            <li>Some labels could disappear, when there is not enough of space for their allocation</li>
            <li>All labels could disappear, when there is not enough space</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Comments on testing : </h5>
        <ul>            
            <li>About animation : it is expected, that animation behaves itself smoothly. It is expected, that there are no jumps, there are no rendering artifacts during animation, and it behaves itself correctly.</li>
            <li>Please, verify rendering at each step: no overlapping content, no graphical artifacts, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Help</h3>
        <ul><li>To add, change, or remove data, use according buttons - changing will be done at index 0.</li>
            <li>To change a property value, you can use according control (TextField for String properties, ToggleButton for boolean properties, ChoiceBox for enums, Slider for double properties). To change a value, set it using some of mentioned control and switch on binding (press toggle button "unbinded" to change its state to "binded").</li>
            <li>You can use Reset button to start again. The whole scene will be dropped.</li></ul>

        <p><b>Animated test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing of animation in TabPane. 
            Actions of adding new tab, and removing existing tab can be animated or not. 
            When you add new tab, and adding is animated, tab should appear smoothly, 
            if it is not animated - at once. The same about removing.
            And we need to test switching of animated/not animated actions. For animated case - to check, that it is done well.
        </p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that Animated property of tap pane can be switched, and quality animation itself.</p>
        <h3>Test case.</h3>
        <ul><li>Change toggle button pressed state to see text "Animated".</li>
            <li>Testing animated property, check, that animation is done or not done, according to animated property value.</li>
            <li>Testing animated property, fail test if you see wrong, not smooth, strange animation, or graphical artifacts.</li>
            <li>Add several tabs at 0, at the end, in the middle (setting according index into text field).</li>
            <li>Remove tabs in the beginning and in the end, and in the middle.</li>
            <li>Switch animated property to false, switching the toggle button pressed state.</li>
            <li>Add several tabs at 0, at the end, in the middle (setting according index into text field).</li>
            <li>Remove several tabs in the beginning and in the end, and in the middle.</li>

        <p><b>MenuBar Add Menu Test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standard JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that each window uses its own menu bar.
        <h3>Test case 1</h3>
        <ul><li>Press "Use system menu bar" toggle button on the first panel</li>
            <li>Verify that system menu with prefix #1 is at the top</li>
            <li>At the bottom press "Clone window" button</li>
            <li>Verify that second window has appeared with the title "Second window"</li>
            <li>Press "Use system menu bar" toggle button on the first panel of the second window</li>
            <li>Verify that menu items begin with "Clone#1"</li>
            <li>Click on the first window</li>
            <li>Verify that menu has changed and menu items begin with #1</li>
            <li>Click on the second window and verify that menu has changed and menu items begin with Clone#1</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directory chooser manual test</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

        JavaFX provide common access to native file and directory choosers. 
        Directory chooser allows to select a single directory. We will test it.

        <h3>Note</h3>

        There is a "No errors" label in the bottom of the scene. If any error 
        happens, in the place of this label will be shown an indication about 
        error, and error will be printed into error output. Please, check this 
        label, on each step, and fail the test, if you see any exception.

        <h3>Step 1: Open/close case.</h3>
        <ul><li>Press "Open Dir FX" button to see the directory chooser.</li>
            <li>Close directory chooser.</li>
            <li>Check that there are no exceptions, everything works fine,
                "no dir choosen" changed to message about "null" file.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Directory choosing.</h3>
        <ul><li>Open directory chooser via "Open Dir FX" button.</li>
            <li>Select any folder you like. And press select.</li>
            <li>Check that there are no exceptions, everything works fine,
                result points to the directory you've selected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Selecting of typed in folder name.</h3>
        <ul><li>Open directory chooser via "Open Dir FX" button.</li>
            <li>Type name of any folder, which you see in shown area (or 
                navigate to any location, where folders are present) 
                in an according field. And press select.</li>
            <li>Check that there are no exceptions, everything works fine,
                result points to the directory you've selected.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 4: Title property checking.</h3>
        Directory chooser can have a specified title.
        <ul><li>Print "Custom title" in a text field for Title.</li>
            <li>Open directory chooser via "Open Dir FX" button.</li>
            <li>Check that that title of opened window is "Custom title" (if applicable).</li>
            <li>Close dialog, and check, that there are no errors.</li>
        </ul>

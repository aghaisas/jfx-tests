        <p><b>MenuBar Add Menu Test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standard JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that stage has only one system menu.
        <h3>Test case 1</h3>
        <ul><li>Press "Use system menu bar" toggle button on the first panel</li>
            <li>Press "Use system menu bar" toggle button on the second panel</li>
            <li>Verify that system menu with prefix #1 is at the top</li>
            <li>Unpress "Use system menu bar" toggle button on the first panel</li>
            <li>Verify that there is no system menu at the top</li>
            <li>Unpress "Use system menu bar" toggle button on the second panel</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case 2</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Press "Use system menu bar (using CSS)" on the second panel</li>
                <li>Press "Use system menu bar (using CSS)" on the first panel</li>
                <li>Verify that system menu with prefix #2 is at the top</li>

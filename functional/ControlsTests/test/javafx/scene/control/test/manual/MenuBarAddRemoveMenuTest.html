        <p><b>MenuBar Add Menu Test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standart JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that adding or removing menus to MenuBar work correctly for MacOS.

            <li>Verify that "Last selected item" label at the left-bottom corner of test application contains the name of the last selected menu item</li>
            <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "false".</li>
            <li>Verify that "Menu 3" has also been added to MenuBar.</li>
            <li>Repeat for different positions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case 2</h3>

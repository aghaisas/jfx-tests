        <p><b>MenuBar graphic property test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standart JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that you can set graphic to some menus or menu items in system menu on MacOS.
        <ul><li>Definition: "graphic" is a node, which appears on a left side of menu name.
                In this test case, graphics - are rectangles (blue, red and green).
                When you do this test, check, that rectangles are shown, or there 
                is no any rectangles in the menu. Also, check, that when you move 
                mouse over that menus (or menu items), rectangle is shown correctly, 
                and menu looks fine.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case. Setting graphic nodes.</h3>
        <ul><li>Switch on a toggle button "Set graphics".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} now have rectangles.</li>
            <li>Switch off a toggle button "Set graphics".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} now DON'T have rectangles.</li>
            <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "true".</li>
            <li>Switch on a toggle button "Set graphics".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} still DON'T have rectangles (in system menu bar). That is because system menu bar on MacOS doesn't support graphics. Check, that application continue execution.</li>
            <li>Switch off a toggle button "Set graphics".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} still DON'T have rectangles (in system menu bar). Check, that application continue execution.</li>
            <li>Switch on a toggle button "Set graphics".</li>
            <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "false".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} now have rectangles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Notion</h3>
        <ul><li>You can use "Reset" button to reset testing application.</li></ul>

        <p><b>MenuBar Events Test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standart JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that MenuBar Menu's events are received for MacOS.
        <h3>Test case 1</h3>
        <ul><li>Set useSystemMenu property to "true" by switching "Use system menu bar" toggle button on.</li>
            <li>Clear events log by pressing "Clear Events" button.</li>
            <li>Expand "Menu 0" in MacOS application menu.</li>
            <li>Expand "Menu 0 SubMenu 0" in sub menu.</li>
            <li>Expand "Menu 0 SubMenu 0 SubMenu 0" in sub menu.</li>
            <li>Collapse all menus by clicking outside of menu's area.</li>
            <li>Verify that log contains following:
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnShowing event from Menu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnShown event from Menu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnShowing event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnShown event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnShowing event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnShown event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnHiding event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnHidden event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnHiding event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnHidden event from Menu 0 SubMenu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnHiding event from Menu 0
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;OnHidden event from Menu 0</li>

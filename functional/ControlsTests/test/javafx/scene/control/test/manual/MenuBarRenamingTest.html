        <p><b>MenuBar : menus renaming test.</b>        
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standart JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>            
        <p>This test verifies that you can change name (text property) of menus in system menu on MacOS.
        <ul><li>Definition: changing text (renaming), mean, that name of menu was changed from "some name" to "Renamed some name". So, prefix "Renamed" is added.</li>
            <li>Definition: to check, that menu item was renamed, you need to verify, that prefix "Renamed" was added to mentioned menus.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case. Rename and move.</h3>
        <ul><li>Click button "Rename".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} were renamed.</li>
            <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "true".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} are still renamed.</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case. Move and rename.</h3>
        <ul><li>Click button "Reset".</li>
            <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "true".</li>
            <li>Click button "Rename".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} were renamed.</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Notion</h3>
        <ul><li>You can use "Reset" button to reset testing application.</li></ul>

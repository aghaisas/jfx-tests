        <p><b>Animated test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing of animation in TitledPane. 
            A titled pane has a property "animated", which is boolean (true/false). 
            Only two things could be animated in TitledPane : arrow rotation (when titled
            pane is collapsed or expanded) and content appearing (for expansion/collapsing too).
            If titled pane is animated (animated == true), content should appear smoothly, 
            and arrow should rotate smoothly. If titled pane is not animated (animated == false), 
            content should appear immediately, and arrow should rotate immediately. 
            When content is shown, arrow points down, when content is not shown, arrow points to the right.
            And we need to test it.
        </p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that Animated property of titled pane affects, and animated is done properly.</p>
        <h3>Test case</h3>
        <ul><li>Press toggle button "unbinded" to change its value to "binded".</li>
            <li>Switch animated property to true.</li>
            <li>Expand and collapse a titled pane. Check, that arrow rotates <i>smoothly</i>, and content is expanded and collapsed <i>smoothly</i>.</li>
            <li>Switch animated property to false.</li>
            <li>Expand and collapse a titled pane. Check, that arrow rotates <i>immediately</i>, and content is expanded and collapsed <i>immediately</i>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Help</h3>
        <h4>How to change property value.</h4>
        You see a toggle button on the right side of application, 
        which can be switched to true/false. 
        This toggle button changes value of according property (animated), 
        if it is <i>binded</i> (binded toggle button is selected). In a text field 
        you can observe the current value of the property.

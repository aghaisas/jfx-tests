            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>

            <li>Verify that MenuBar at the left-top corner of test application is invisible.</li>

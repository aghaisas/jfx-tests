        <p><b>MenuBar Initial State Test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standart JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that MenuBar initaal state of MenuBar is correct for MacOS.
        <p>Verify the initial state of MenuBar. It should be placed at the left-top corner of test application and should contains 3 items:  "Menu 1", "Menu 2" and "Menu 3" with 3 levels of submenus. MacOS application menu should be empty.

        <h2>Directory chooser manual test</h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>

            JavaFX provide common access to native file and directory choosers 
            (they are different on different Operation Systems, and each can 
            have its specific). File choosers allow to select file for saving 
            and opening. We will test it.

        <h3>Note</h3>

        <ul><li>There is a "No errors" label in the bottom of the scene. If any 
                error happens, in the place of this label will be shown an 
                indication about error, and error will be printed into error 
                output, and shown in the tooltip of the label. Please, check 
                this label, on each step, and fail the test, if you see any 
                exception.</li>
            <li>Each of buttons ["Save file FX (modal dialog)", 
                "Save file with extension FX (modal dialog)", "Open File FX", 
                "Open File with extension FX", "Open Multiple Files FX", 
                "Open Multiple Files With extensions FX"] (6 buttons) open a 
                dialog for file opening or closing. I will call them "FILE DIALOG
                BUTTONS"</li>
            <li>If a button has text "(modal dialog)", then a dialog will be 
                opened as modal window, and will block the window with buttons.</li>
            <li>If a button has notion "with extensions", it means, that extension
                "*.extension" will be added for saved or opened files.</li>
            <li>Save dialogs will save files to open them later with open dialogs,
                so navigate to a directory, which you have rights to write in. 
                Remove them after testing is finished.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 1: Simple open/close case.</h3>
        <ul><li>For each FILE DIALOG BUTTON do actions below : </li>
            <li>Just press the button to open the dialog.</li>
            <li>Check, that modal dialogs block the underlying window, and non modal don't block.</li>
            <li>Close appeared dialog.</li>
            <li>Check, that returned result is <b>null</b>.</li>
            <li>Check that there are no exceptions, everything works fine</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2: Title could be set.</h3>
        <ul><li>In a text field for Title type "Custom title". It will set a title for file dialog.</li>
            <li>For each FILE DIALOG BUTTON do actions below : </li>
            <li>Open a dialog, check that title of file dialog is "Custom title", close the dialog.</li>

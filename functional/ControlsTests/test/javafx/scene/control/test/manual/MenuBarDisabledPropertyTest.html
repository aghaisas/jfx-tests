        <p><b>MenuBar disable property test</b>
        <p>Notion: This test is targeted for testing System menu bar on MacOS. 
            It is implemented, by making standart JavaFX menuBar, switching 
            useSystemMenu option to true/false, to be a system menu bar (grey menu bar on the top of the screen). 
            On other platforms (like windows, and linux), this option shouldn't 
            affect anyhow, so just press "PASS".</p>                        
        <p>This test verifies that disabling MenuBar or its menus works correctly for MacOS.
        <ul><li>Definition: "disabled" (menuBar, menu, menuItem) - means, that it has 
                more dark grey color, and cannot be pressed (if you click on it 
                with mouse - then nothing should happen).</li>
            <li>To check, that "smth is disabled" - check the color, and check, 
                that there is no reaction on mouse clicks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Test case 1. Menus disabling.</h3>
        <ul><li>Switch on a toggle button "Some menus disable".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} became disabled.</li>
            <li>Switch off a toggle button "Some menus disable".</li>
            <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "true".</li>
            <li>Switch on a toggle button "Some menus disable".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} have become disabled, {"Menu 1"} is still enabled (menus of system menu bar cannot be disabled, but submenus can be disabled).</li>
            <li>Switch off a toggle button "Some menus disable".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} became enabled (in system menu bar).</li>
            <li>Switch on a toggle button "Some menus disable".</li>
            <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "false".</li>
            <li>Check, that {"Menu 0 SubMenu 0", "Menu 1", "Menu 2 SubMenu 2"} are disabled.</li>
        </ul>
    <li>Click "Reset" button.</li>
    <h3>Test case 2. MenuBar disabling checking.</h3>
    <ul><li>Notion: this test case about disabling menuBar. Expected, that all menus in JavaFX menuBar will be disabled, but menus in system menu bar could NOT be disabled (menus cannot be disabled, but their submenus can be).</li>
        <li>Switch on a toggle button "MenuBar disable".</li>
        <li>Check, that all menus became disabled.</li>
        <li>Switch off a toggle button "MenuBar disable".</li>
        <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "true".</li>
        <li>Switch on a toggle button "MenuBar disable".</li>
        <li>Check, that all menus are still enabled (in system menu bar), and application continue execution.</li>
        <li>Switch off a toggle button "MenuBar disable".</li>
        <li>Check, that all menus are still enabled.</li>
        <li>Switch on a toggle button "MenuBar disable".</li>
        <li>Set useSystemMenu property to "false".</li>
        <li>Check, that all menus are disabled in JavaFX menu bar.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Notion</h3>
    <ul><li>You can use "Reset" button to reset testing application.</li></ul>

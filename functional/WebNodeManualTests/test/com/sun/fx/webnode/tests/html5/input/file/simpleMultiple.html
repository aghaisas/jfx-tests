        <h3>Test for FILE input control with MULTIPLE attribute</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wait for test page to load. The application with loaded page should look like below
                (directory where files were generated can be different):<br/>
                <img src="images/simple-multiple.png"/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Choose Files" button. A modal window with file selection should open.<br/>
                Go to the directory where files were generated:<br/>
                <img src="images/generated-in.png"/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>Select "test1.txt" file, and press "Open" button.<br/>
                Modal window with file selection should close, and "test1.txt" text should appear next to "Choose Files" button.<br/>
                Below the button, the name of the file should appear with a non-zero number next to it:<br/>
                <img src="images/simple-multiple-1.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Choose Files" button again.<br/>
                A modal window with file selection should open again.<br/>
                Go to the directory where files were generated.<br/>
                Select files "test1.txt" and "test2.txt" (e.g., using left mouse button and Control key).<br/>
            </li>
            <li>Press "Open" button.<br/>
                Modal window with file selection should close, and the following text should now be next to "Choose Files" button: "2 files".<br/>
                The previous text should not be visible.<br/>
                Below the button, "test1.txt" and "test2.txt" lines should appear, each with a non-zero number next to it:<br/>
                <img src="images/simple-multiple-2.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Choose Files" button again.<br/>
                A modal window with file selection should open again.<br/>
                Click on "Cancel".<br/>
                Modal window with file selection should close, and the text "2 files" should remain next to "Choose Files" button.<br/>
                The text below the button also should not disappear or change.
            </li>
        </ol>
        The test passes if all steps pass.

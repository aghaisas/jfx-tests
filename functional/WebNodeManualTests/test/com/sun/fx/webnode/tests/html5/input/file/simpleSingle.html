        <h3>Test for FILE input control</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wait for test page to load. The application with loaded page should look like below
                (directory where files were generated can be different):<br/>
                <img src="images/simple-single.png"/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Choose File" button. A modal window with file selection should open.<br/>
                Go to the directory where files were generated:<br/>
                <img src="images/generated-in.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>Select file "test1.txt", and press "Open" button.<br/>
                Modal window with file selection should close, and "test1.txt" text should appear next to "Choose File" button.<br/>
                Below the button, the name of the file should appear with a non-zero number next to it:<br/>
                <img src="images/simple-1.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Choose File" button again.<br/>
                A modal window with file selection should open again.<br/>
                Go to the directory where files were generated.<br/>
                Select the "testveryveryverylongname.txt" file.<br/>
            </li>
            <li>Press "Open" button.<br/>
                Modal window with file selection should close, and the following text should now be next to "Choose File" button: "testveryvery...ongname.txt".<br/>
                The previous text should not be visible.<br/>
                Below the button, the name of the file should appear with a non-zero number next to it:<br/>
                <img src="images/simple-2.png"/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Choose File" button again.<br/>
                A modal window with file selection should open again.<br/>
                Go to the directory where files were generated.<br/>
                Try to select two files using left mouse button and Control key.<br/>
                You should not be able to do that.
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Cancel" button.<br/>
                Modal window with file selection should close, and the name of the previously selected file should remain next to "Choose File" button.<br/>
                The text below the button also should not disappear.
            </li>
        </ol>
        The test passes if all steps pass.

        <h3>Test for uploading single files with FILE input control with MULTIPLE attribute</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wait for test page to load.  The application with loaded page should look like below
                (directory where files were generated can be different):<br/>
                <img src="images/simple-multiple.png"/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Choose Files" button. A modal window with file selection should open.<br/>
                Go to the directory where files were generated:<br/>
                <img src="images/generated-in.png"/><br/>
            </li>
            <li>Select files "test1.txt" and "test2.txt" (e.g., using left mouse button and Control key) and press "Open" button.<br/>
                Modal window with file selection should close, and the following text should now be next to "Choose Files" button: "2 files".<br/>
            </li>
            <li>Click on "Upload" button.<br/>
                The following text should appear:<br/>
                Files successfully uploaded:<br/>
                1: Content-Disposition: form-data; name="test"; filename="test1.txt" Content-Type: text/plain test test1.txt<br/>
                2: Content-Disposition: form-data; name="test"; filename="test2.txt" Content-Type: text/plain test test2.txt
            </li>
        </ol>
        The test passes if all steps pass.
